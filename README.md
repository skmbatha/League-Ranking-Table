# How to run

- Run without input files:  *python3 rankGames.py*
- Run with input files:  *python3 rankGames.py inputFile1 inputFile2 ...* 


# Running the tests

The test files are inside the test folder. There is a python text file
and it contains tests. They are assessed visually. The output generated
from the tests is printed on the terminal.

To initiate the tests, run:

*python3 test.py*

## Your own tests

You can also define your own tests and run them directly on the program source file.

- Create a *test X.txt* file
- Implement the test by running *python3 rankGames.py test/testX.txt* (you must be in the root folder).
